%  INPOLY: Point-in-polygon testing.
%
% Determine whether a series of points lie within the bounds of a polygon
% in the 2D plane. General non-convex, multiply-connected polygonal
% regions can be handled.
%
% SHORT SYNTAX:
%
%   in = inpoly(p, node);
%
%   p   : The points to be tested as an Nx2 array [x1 y1; x2 y2; etc].
%   node: The vertices of the polygon as an Mx2 array [X1 Y1; X2 Y2; etc].
%         The standard syntax assumes that the vertices are specified in
%         consecutive order.
%
%   in  : An Nx1 logical array with IN(i) = TRUE if P(i,:) lies within the
%         region.
%
% LONG SYNTAX:
%
%  [in, on] = inpoly(p, node, edge, tol);
%
%  edge: An Mx2 array of polygon edges, specified as connections between
%        the vertices in NODE: [n1 n2; n3 n4; etc]. The vertices in NODE
%        do not need to be specified in connsecutive order when using the
%        extended syntax.
%
%  on  : An Nx1 logical array with ON(i) = TRUE if P(i,:) lies on a
%        polygon edge. (A tolerance is used to deal with numerical
%        precision, so that points within a distance of
%        reltol*min(bbox(node)) from a polygon edge are considered "on" the 
%        edge.
%
% EXAMPLE:
%
%   polydemo;       % Will run a few examples
%
% See also INPOLYGON

% The algorithm is based on the crossing number test, which counts the
% number of times a line that extends from each point past the right-most
% region of the polygon intersects with a polygon edge. Points with odd
% counts are inside. A simple implementation of this method requires each
% wall intersection be checked for each point, resulting in an O(N*M)
% operation count.
%
% This implementation does better in 2 ways:
%
%   1. The test points are sorted by y-value and a binary search is used to
%      find the first point in the list that has a chance of intersecting
%      with a given wall. The sorted list is also used to determine when we
%      have reached the last point in the list that has a chance of
%      intersection. This means that in general only a small portion of
%      points are checked for each wall, rather than the whole set.
%
%   2. The intersection test is simplified by first checking against the
%      bounding box for a given wall segment. Checking against the bbox is
%      an inexpensive alternative to the full intersection test and allows
%      us to take a number of shortcuts, minimising the number of times the
%      full test needs to be done.
